Now Watching: Edge of Tomorrow

i watched "edge of tomorrow" today at my friend's house it was actually so cool
Edge of Tomorrow is basically an extremely violent Groundhog Day
Watching Edge of Tomorrow makes me realize every day we wake up is just another chance at a do-over of the previous day
Enjoyed the hell out of "Edge Of Tomorrow", can't remember the last time i got this excited about a sci fi movie
All You Need is Kill. Edge of Tomorrow. Live Die Repeat. Three names, one movie, and all of it sounds pretty bad to me.

Just got done watching Edge of Tomorrow. My life seems so mundane now.
