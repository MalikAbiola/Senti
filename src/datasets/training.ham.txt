I'll say this now Edge of Tomorrow is one of the most underrated movies of this year. Go rent this movie, it fucking rules!
I saw Edge of Tomorrow last night, really enjoyed the film. But one thing really annoyed me was
Edge of Tomorrow, such a good movie! #praise √∞≈∏‚Äò¬è√∞≈∏‚Äò¬è
Now Watching: Edge of Tomorrow
Just watched Edge of Tomorrow - it is like a combination of Saving Private Ryan, Independence Day, Source Code, and Groundhog Day. Not bad.
Edge Of tomorrow was an amazing movie!!!
Edge of Tomorrow is funny as fuck. :"))))) Hahahahah
just watched the edge of tomorrow... mind blown
edge of tomorrow was actually a really good Tom cruise movie
i watched "edge of tomorrow" today at my friend's house it was actually so cool
Edge of Tomorrow is basically an extremely violent Groundhog Day
Watching Edge of Tomorrow makes me realize every day we wake up is just another chance at a do-over of the previous day
Enjoyed the hell out of "Edge Of Tomorrow", can't remember the last time i got this excited about a sci fi movie
All You Need is Kill. Edge of Tomorrow. Live Die Repeat. Three names, one movie, and all of it sounds pretty bad to me.
Now onto 'All You Need Is Kill', what the film Edge of Tomorrow was based off.
Just got done watching Edge of Tomorrow. My life seems so mundane now.

Eminem is great af, get over the fact that he's white and realize no one could touch his story telling AT ALL

Eminem Show is probably the greatest rap album of all time. Not sure yet. Gonna put together a top 10. I'll keep yous updated b
White ppl will argue that Eminem had the best verse in Forever
